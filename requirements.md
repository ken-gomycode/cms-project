Project Title: Content Management System

Description:
A Content Management System is a software application that enables users to create, manage, modify, and publish digital 
content without requiring specialized technical knowledge. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing website content, 
typically separating content from design and presentation.

    Version control and content drafting

2. User Management
    Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Author, Subscriber)
    Authentication and authorization systems
    User permissions and privileges

3. Database Management
    Storage of content, user data, and metadata
    Efficient querying and retrieval mechanisms
    Data relationships and taxonomy

4. Template/Theme System
    Separation of content and presentation
    Customizable layouts and designs
    Responsive design support
